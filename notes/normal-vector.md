title: Normal Vector
---

The normal vector to any plane `$ ax + by + cz = k $` is
`$ ai + bj + ck $`. From the definition of the dot product:

`$$
N \cdot \begin{bmatrix}
          x - x_0 \\
          y - y_0 \\
          z - z_0
        \end{bmatrix} = 0
$$`

Then it is trivial that:

`$$
\begin{aligned}
a(x - x_0) + b(y - y_0) + c(z - z_0) &= 0 \\
ax + by + cz &= k
\end{aligned}
$$`
