Notes
=====

My personal notes on various topics. Notes are in Markdown,
rendered by noterender_. To view and edit the notes (recommended
to be ran in a ``virtualenv``, but I don't ``\o/``)::

    $ make setup
    $ make # watches current directory

Then in a separate session just do::

    $ open build/<name>.html
    $ vim
